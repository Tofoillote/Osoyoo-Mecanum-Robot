# Osoyoo-Mecanum-Robot
my Arduino coding and android APK code to make this thing work a little better
This thing is a "gadget toy" you can see here : https://osoyoo.com/category/osoyoo-robot-car-kit/m1-0-mecanum-wheel-metal-chassis-robotic/
In fact is a very technological one, that you can learn alot of coding and control/command operation with.

The Android APK is developped with http://appinventor.mit.edu/ the MIT APK online tools. .aia files are shared.

My purpose is to make an more intuivite application (and sorry this is yet in french) might be translated one day or in a one pal fork ^^

Sorry that I'm a total noob at sharing code under github

based from the online available version of .INO faile from OSOYOO, 5D version.
The robot work as a WIFI hotspot with UDP listening to IP adress 192.168.1.4 port 8888

This explore the moves from strafe left/right, diagonals, forward, backward, turning left/right or in place clockwise/counter clockwise.

This one APK add a speed control from a sliding cursor.

One direction work while you have the direction button touched. Immediatly stop at realease.

Speed isn't yet evolving while running, this is in the "to do" list.

ENJOY ! ^^
